PCINFO - Calculate information needed for photoclinometry
.HELP
Calculates and reports information useful for running the
programs pc2d and pcsi that perform two-dimensional photo-
clinometry (shape from shading, or topographic modeling based 
on image brightness) using the finite-element method of Kirk 
(1987), which is described further by Kirk et al. (2003).

One output, the "azimuth of characteristics," is the
direction in which topographic slopes (relative to a zero
surface or "datum" that may be inclined relative to the
camera) have a maximum effect on topographic shading in
the image.  Small slopes at right angles to this direction 
have minimal effect on shading and hence are invisible.  
The direction of the characteristics is generally toward
the sun, but also depends on the orientation of the datum
(determined from the image labels) and the photometric
properties of the surface.

The azimuth of characteristics is important because albedo
variations on the surface will cause artifacts in the
photoclinometric topography in the form of stripes along
this direction.  A small amount of striping in this direction
will also occur even if the albedo is completely uniform.
Standard post-processing of the output from pc2d or pcsi
therefore includes rotating the elevation model so that
the characteristic direction is aligned with the sample
axis, using the ISIS destriping filter procedure dstripe
to suppress stripes, and then re-rotating the model to its
original orientation.  The azimuth of characteristics is
returned to TAE for use in such processing, and is also
reported in the print file.

This program also calculates the memory needs of pc2d and
pcsi for a variety of options.  The memory required to use
the fast "SSIPSF-PI" method to generate an initial approxi-
mation to the topography depends not only on image size but 
also on the azimuth of characteristics.  Memory required for
subsequent refinement of the model depends on which of the
available solution methods (successive over-relaxation, 
incomplete Cholesky/conjugate gradient method, or direct
matrix factorization) are used and the number factors of
two by which the image resolution will be reduced during
processing to speed convergence of long spatial wavelengths
of the solution.  Memory requirements for all methods are
reported in the print file.

.VAR FROM
The image file upon which photoclinometry will be performed.
.VAR SFROM
Input subcube specifier for the FROM file.  Selects the part of 
the input cube file upon which photoclinometry will be performed. 
The format for the SFROM parameter is 
ss-es(sinc):sl-el(linc):sb-eb(binc) where:

ss = starting sample   es = ending sample  sinc = sample increment
sl = starting line     el = ending line    linc = line increment

The default value of NULL will select the entire input cube.  If
the line and sample increments are not equal, the map scale will 
not be accurate.
.VAR DATUMTYP
Type of model for the datum, or mean planetary surface.  If
DATUMTYP=1, the datum is a plane tangent at the image point
at which geometric quantities are calculated (see X, Y).  If
DATUMTYP=2, the datum is a portion of a sphere.  In this case
the size and location of the sphere may be calculated from label
information or overridden by user input (see RADIUS, XSPHERE,
YSPHERE).  Default is 1.
.VAR X

will be calculated from SPICE label information.  These quantities

If no value is given for X the sample coordinate of the center of 
the full frame will be used.

will be calculated from SPICE label information.  These quantities
will be calculated at sample X, line Y measured relative to the 
FULL camera frame from which the current data were extracted.
If no value is given for Y the line coordinate of the center of 
the full frame will be used.
.VAR DISTORTD
Do the images still contain camera distortions?  If YES, the X,Y

of the frame will be corrected before being used to find the
illumination and viewing geometry.  Default is NO (no correction).
.VAR RADIUS
Radius in km of the spherical datum model to be used if DATUMTYP=2
(q.v.).  If RADIUS=<0, the planetary radius read from PLANET.SAV
will be used, but if RADIUS>0 the value input will be used.
.VAR XSPHERE
Affects the center that will be used for a spherical datum model.
If no value is given, the center of the disk will be calculated
from the label information.
.VAR YSPHERE
Affects the center that will be used for a spherical datum model.
If no value is given, the center of the disk will be calculated
.VAR PHOFUNC
This parameter selects the type of photometric function
model used to describe the planetary surface. The parameters
used differ between the photometric functions.

The functions are defined as follows, where phase is
the phase angle, and u0 and u are the cosines of the
incidence and emission angles, respectively

Lambert
FUNC=u0

Lommel-Seeliger
FUNC=u0/(u0+u)

Minnaert
FUNC=u0**K * u**(K-1)

Lunar-Lambert ("lunar" part is Lommel-Seeliger)
FUNC=(1-L)*u0 + 2*L*u0/(u0+u)


Hapke - Henyey-Greenstein
Complete Hapke (1981; 1984; 1986) photometric model
with Henyey-Greenstein single-particle phase function
whose coefficients are HG1 and HG2, plus single scattering
albedo WH, opposition surge parameters HH and B0, and
macroscopic roughness THETA.

Hapke - Legendre
Similar to the previous except that the single particle
phase function is a two-term Legendre polynomial with
coefficients BH and CH.

Hapke - Henyey-Greeenstein smooth
Substantially simplified version of Hapke-Henyey-Greenstein
function that omits the opposition effect as well as the
(very slow) macroscopic roughness correction.  For a smooth
model with opposition effect, use the full Hapke-Henyey
function with THETA=0.

Hapke - Legendre smooth
Simplified Hapke model with Legendre single particle phase
function, no opposition surge, and no roughness correction.

.VAR K
Exponent that governs limb-darkening in the Minnaert
photometric function: PHOFUNC=u0**K * u**(K-1). Values
generally fall in the range from 0.5 ("lunar-like", 
almost no limb darkening) to 1.0 (Lambert function).
.VAR L
Weight that governs limb-darkening in the Lunar-Lambert
photometric function: PHOFUNC=(1-L)*u0 + 2*L*u0/(u0+u).
Values generally fall in the range from 0 (Lambert
function) to 1 (Lommel-Seeliger or "lunar" function).
.VAR WH
Single-scattering albedo of surface particles, used if
PHOFUNC=HAPHEN, HAPLEG, HAPH_S, or HAPL_S.  See Hapke (1981).
.VAR B0
Magnitude of the opposition effect for the surface, used
if PHOFUNC=HAPHEN, HAPLEG, HAPH_S, or HAPL_S.  See Hapke (1984).
.VAR HH
Width parameter for the opposition effect for the surface,
used if FUNC=HAPHEN, HAPLEG, HAPH_S, or HAPL_S.  See Hapke 
(1984).
.VAR THETA
"Macroscopic roughness" of the surface as it affects the
photometric behavior, used if PHOFUNC=HAPHEN or HAPLEG.  
This is the RMS slope at scales larger than the distance 
photons penetrate the surface but smaller than a pixel.  
See Hapke (1986).  The roughness correction, which will
be evaluated if THETA is given any value other than 0.0,
is extremely slow.
.VAR HG1
Asymmetry parameter used in the Henyey-Greenstein model
for the scattering phase function of single particles
in the surface, used if PHOFUNC=HAPHEN or HAPH_S.  See Hapke
(1981).  The two-parameter Henyey-Greenstein function is
P(phase) = (1-HG2) * (1-HG1**2)/(1+HG1**2+2*HG1*COS(PHASE))**1.5
         +    HG2  * (1-HG1**2)/(1+HG1**2-2*HG1*COS(PHASE))**1.5
.VAR HG2
Second parameter of the two-parameter Henyey-Greenstein
model for the scattering phase function of single particles
in the surface, used if PHOFUNC=HAPHEN or HAPH_S.  This 
parameter controls a the proportions in a linear mixture 
of ordinary Heneyey-Greenstein phase functions with 
asymmetry parameters equal to +HG1 and -HG1.  See HG1 for
the full formula.
.VAR BH
When PHOFUNC=HAPLEG or HAPL_S, a two-term Legendre polynomial
is used for the scattering phase function of single 
particles in the surface
P(phase) = 1 + BH * P1(COS(PHASE)) + CH * P2(COS(PHASE))
.VAR CH
When PHOFUNC=HAPLEG or HAPL_S, a two-term Legendre polynomial
is used for the scattering phase function of single 
particles in the surface
P(phase) = 1 + BH * P1(COS(PHASE)) + CH * P2(COS(PHASE))
